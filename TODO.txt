# TODO Build an interactive mode.
# TODO Further document preamble.
    # TODO Should writecsv() be handled by dataparser?
    # TODO Could writecsv be causing the memory leak? Does it read the file every iteration?
        # TODO Should dataparser instead of breaking and returning upon no new information, check for table validity and
        else:  # TODO Define parsing logic for lines on NT based ping requests.
# TODO Remove pingfrequency argument, current build does not use it.
    # TODO Should ping() handle arguments inside functions or inside initial runtime as current?
# TODO Define a backend for matplotlib that enables bundled usage.
